<h1>Request a Jira account</h1>
<p>Jira is a powerful tool for reporting, tracking, and resolving issues with products ASF projects develop and support. Its value becomes less when spammers and automated tools flood the feed with bogus reports. The ASF therefore does not permit submitting anonymous Jira tickets.</p>
<p>If you are a committer to an ASF project, use your ASF id and password to login to JIRA and create tickets. If not, use this form to request an account that will let you submit tickets to ASF projects.</p>
