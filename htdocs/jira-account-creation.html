<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>This feature helps projects create Jira accounts for users wishing to interact with projects using the
Jira issue tracker for development purposes. As public signup for Jira accounts has been disabled
(as per <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/jx9d7sp690ro660pjpttwtg209w3m39w">this thread</a>), projects
and new contributors will now need to use this tool to set up accounts for new users.</p>

<p>If the request is not approved, notification goes to the project PMC involved and to the requestor.</p>
