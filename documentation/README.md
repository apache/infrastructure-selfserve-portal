# Self-serve portal documentation
This directory contains the documentation for the various [self-serve](https://selfserve.apache.org) features.
Each self-serve feature has an associated .md file with documentation on how the feature works and the policies surrounding it.

**Note**: as of March 2023 Self-serve does not have a method for rendering MD files. To update the UI, please edit the files in the htdocs directory.

## External self-serve features
Certain features listed on the front page of the self-serve portal are links to external
self-serve services, and are not documented here. As of this writing, they are:

- Create a Git repository: https://gitbox.apache.org/boxer/?action=newrepo
- Edit your identity: [https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committer/\_\_self\_\_](https://whimsy.apache.org/roster/committer/__self__)
- Reset your password: https://id.apache.org/reset/enter
