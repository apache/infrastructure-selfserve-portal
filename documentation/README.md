# Self-serve portal documentation
This directory contains the documentation for the various self-serve features.
Each self-serve feature has an associated .md file with documentation on how the feature works and the policies surrounding it.

## External self-serve features
Certain features listed on the front page of the self-serve portal are links to external 
self-serve services, and are not documented here. As of this writing, they are:
